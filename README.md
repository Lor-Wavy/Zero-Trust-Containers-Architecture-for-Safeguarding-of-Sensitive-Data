# Zero-Trust-Containers-Architecture-for-Safeguarding-of-Sensitive-Data

The increasing reliance on containerized applications for sensitive data necessitates enhanced security strategies, as traditional perimeter defenses are proving inadequate. The Zero Trust (ZT) architecture, which does not assume inherent trust in users or devices, is presented as a viable solution for bolstering security in containerized environments. By continuously assessing access requests, ZT can mitigate risks associated with data breaches. This study explores the integration of ZT principles with containerization, reviews advanced methods in the field, identifies research gaps, and proposes future research directions to effectively safeguard sensitive data in containerized applications.
